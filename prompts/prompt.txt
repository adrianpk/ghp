[EVALUATION RUBRIC & REQUIREMENTS]
- Respond ONLY with a single, raw JSON object. Do not include markdown fences or explanations.
- Base your judgment STRICTLY on the provided code snippet. If the snippet is insufficient for a category (e.g., a config file for "testing"), assign a low score or zero and explain in the notes.
- Be concise. Point to specific line numbers or identifiers in your notes and citations.
- SECURITY: This is critical. Differentiate between high-risk vulnerabilities and best-practice advice.
  - HIGH RISK: Hardcoded secrets that look like production keys (e.g., `sk_live_...`, long random strings). Flag these immediately.
  - LOW RISK / NOTE: Obvious placeholders (`YOUR_KEY_HERE`, `changeme`, `example-secret`), keys in example files (`.env.example`), or empty strings. Mention these as a configuration best practice, not a critical vulnerability.
